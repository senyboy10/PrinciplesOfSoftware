	List of changes made to Homework7 model:
( Why changes were necessary and what I could have done better to create a more general and reusable model)
( If the answer is None, then No changes were made)

I made a lot of changes to this part of the homework. 

1) I added a new method called read_directions(node1, node2) that returns correct building/intersection IDs
	with their respective coordinates.
	it is a LinkedHashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer> >.
						  String is the ID of the building/intersection
						  ArrayList<Integer> holds the x and y value of the building/intersection
2) I added couples variables to help implement the read_diections. 
	~an ArrayList<String> called valid_route which represents correct building/intersection IDS
	~an Accessor method called convertNameToID(type String) which helps me convert
		the name of the building the user selects on the interface to the building building ID
