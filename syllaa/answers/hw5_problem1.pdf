1. The functions X m(X y, String s) and Y m(Object y, Object s) are function subtypes. 
	
  The functions: 
-  X m(X y, String s) would be overriding. 
-  Y m(Object y, object s) would be overloading 
-  Object m(X y, String s) would be overriding. 
-  Z m(Y y, String s) would be overloading. 

2. 
	1. No, 
	IsoscelesTriangle is not a true subtype of Triangle since not every IsoscelesTriangle 
	can be a Triangle. That been said, if the values in the Triangle constructor are all different,
	 it cannot be replaced with an IsoscelesTriangle constructor and expect to represent the same Triangle. 
	 
	 2. Squid is not a true subtype as you cannot use Squids everywhere where there are Vertebrate. Some animals may have neck bones. 
		Human is a true subtype of Vertebrate since all Humans are Vertebrate, and the Vertebrate needs more than 0 (>0) neckBones and Humans return 
		7 neckBones. 
		
	3. MountainBike is NOT a true subtype of Bicycle because it has an extra parameter in the constructor. Wherever you 
	   make the a Bicycle,  a MountainBike cannot be made since there is no startHeight var. 
	   
	4. n Account cannot substitute a ConcurrentAccount , therefore ConcurrentAccount is not a true subtype of Account. also may not
		return the same information as an Account with the same values depending on if two people are using the ConcurrentAccount.
