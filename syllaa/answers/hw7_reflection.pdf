1. I could have started the hw earlier, but with capstone and other classes, I did not have much time
	I was having some issues with Git. That issue took more than 8 hours to fix.
	I had already committed some dummy file on the server that was broken and I did not need it. 
	Although the file was locally deleted on my computer, it was still on the server. after it took me so long 
	to find out that was the file that was causing error, I deleted it on eclipse and made new push but it was not working. 
	I had to use the terminal to be able to delete it using command line.
	after deleting that file, my grade went from 0 to to a 21. Unfortunately it was already midnight. 
	I would go see the professor about this. 


2. I don't have much to say about the staff since I did not go to office hours.
	 However lectures are more interesting and I like the examples we do in class
3. I learned how to output to a file. Also I am working on a project that has to do with map and finding location on RPI campus,
	This homework will help me with that.
