# PrinciplesOfSoftware

The course is a study of important concepts in software design, implementation, and testing. Topics include specification, 
abstraction with classes, design principles and patterns, testing, refactoring, the software development process, 
GUI and event-driven programming. The course introduces implementation and testing tools, including IDEs, version control systems,
and other frameworks. The overarching goal of the course is for students to learn how to write correct and maintainable software.

Prerequisite: CSCI 1200 Data Structures and CSCI 2200 Foundations of Computer Science.

 

Concretely, students who successfully complete the course should be able to:

1)    apply fundamental principles such as reasoning about code, specification, abstraction, design patterns, testing, refactoring and software process, towards building software systems

2)    demonstrate competence with modern software engineering tools such as the Eclipse IDE, the JUnit Framework, revision control, test coverage tools and others

3)    demonstrate competence with the Java programming language and the Java libraries.
